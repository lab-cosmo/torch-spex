"""Radial embeddings.

Here, we map the distance between atoms to an array of numbers that represent
this particular distance. In other words, we expand the distance in some kind of *basis*
to provide input features for ML models.

Currently, only one basis is implemented, the ``LaplacianEigenstates`` basis.
